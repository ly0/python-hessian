About

This is a python-hessian fork for python3.4

**python-hessian** is a Python implemention of Hessian, a binary web services
protocol. It supports the [Hessian 1.0.2 specification]
(http://hessian.caucho.com/doc/hessian-1.0-spec.xtp) and the
[Hessian 2.0 Serialization Protocol]
(http://hessian.caucho.com/doc/hessian-serialization.html). The library
is a fork of mustaine (https://github.com/bgilmore/mustaine), which is no
longer maintained. It provides a standard HTTP-based client
as well as a general-purpose serialization library.

Usage
-----

### Using `pyhessian.client`

Testing against [Cauchoâ€™s](http://hessian.caucho.com/) reference service:

```python
from pyhessian.client import HessianProxy
service = HessianProxy("http://hessian.caucho.com/test/test")
print service.replyDate_1()
```

### Examples
Here is the example codes in situation which you need to serialize a java object to hessian.
```python
from pyhessian.protocol import cls_factory
from pyhessian.client import HessianProxy

NiceObject = cls_factory(
    name='com.company.objects.NiceObject',
    fields=['id', 'name', 'address']
    )

nice_object = NiceObject(id=998, name='Wondernaire', address='GFW Inside')

url = r'http://SOMEURL'
service = HessianProxy(url)
data = nice_object
res = service.NiceObjectSubmit(data)
```
